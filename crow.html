        <p>Once upon a time, on a hot summer day, a thirsty crow was searching for water. After a long search, he finally found a pitcher in a garden.</p>
        
        <p>The crow was excited but soon realized that the water level was too low for him to reach with his beak. He thought hard about how to solve this problem.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, he had an idea! He looked around and saw some pebbles nearby. The clever crow began picking up the pebbles, one by one, and dropped them into the pitcher.</p>

        <p>With each pebble he dropped, the water level rose a little higher. Finally, after several pebbles, the water level was high enough for the crow to drink.</p>

        <p>The crow drank the water and felt refreshed. He was proud of his cleverness and learned that thinking creatively can solve difficult problems.</p>

        <p>From that day on, the thirsty crow became known as a wise bird, reminding everyone that ingenuity can help overcome challenges.</p>
